# Square Run
> This is small project in which I try to implement some machine learning techniques
## Prototype
This is a small implementation of a genetic algorithm in a game.
The game is a simple side-scroller in which a square must jump over the wall.
The algorithm must determinate the minimum range of distances in which the bots must begin to jump over the wall.
